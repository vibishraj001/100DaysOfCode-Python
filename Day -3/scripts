print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

if height >= 120 :
    print(" Your can ride a rollercoaster")
else :
    print("Sorry you have to grow taller before tou can ride.")

task -2 :    The modulo operator gives you the remainder of a division.

6 % 2 #will be 0

6 % 5 #will be 1

6 % 4 #will be 2

PAUSE 1 - What is 10 % 3?
What do you think this will output?

print(10 % 3)

PAUSE 2 - Check Odd or Even
Write some code using what you have learnt about the modulo operator and conditional checks in Python to check if the number in he input area is odd or even. If it's odd print out the word "Odd" otherwise printout "Even".



print(10 % 3)

num =int(input("Enter you number"))
if num % 2 == 0 :
    print(f"Your number {num}is Even")
else:
    print(f"your number {num} is odd")


task - 3 :

You can put if/else statements inside other if/else statements. This is known as nesting. e.g.

if maths_score >= 90:
    if english_score >= 90:
        print("You're good at everything")
    else:
        print("You're good at maths")
if english_score >= 90:
    print("You're good at english)
In this case only when a student has over 90 on maths and english, do they get "You are good at everything".

Note: You can also have if statements that don't have a paired else statement.


print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

if height >= 120:
    print("You can ride the rollercoaster")
    age=int(input("Enter your age :"))

    if age <= 12 :
        print("Please pay $5")

    elif age <= 18 :
        print("Plases pay $7")

    else :
        print("Plases pay $12")

else:

    print("Sorry you have to grow taller before you can ride.")
